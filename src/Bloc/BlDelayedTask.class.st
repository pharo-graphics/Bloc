"
BlDelayedTask delays its action until after the specified time by being scheduled on every pulse, but simply marking itself for requeue if the appointed time has not yet been reached.

 
## Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points.

### Instance Variables
	delay:		<Object>
	element:		<Object>
	isRunning:		<Object>
	requeue:		<Boolean>
	startTime:		<Object>
	time:		<Object>


### Implementation Points

The task state is currently not thread-safe, so the time between checking the task state and acting on it provides a window where another process could issue a conflicting instruction.  This hasn't been a problem so far, so is left open.

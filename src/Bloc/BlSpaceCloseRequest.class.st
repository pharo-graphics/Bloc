I am a space close request sent by a windowing system asking a user application to handle a click on a window close button.

Close request can allow us to implement a dialog question asking if use actually want to close a window. If window indeed should be closed an event handler of close request should ask space explicitely:
```
space close
```

After that space sents an actual BlSpaceClosedEvent that indicates that windows was indeed closed

"
My subclasses are canvas specific. They are responsible of measuring a text paragraph by an editor.
The result of measuring is an instance of a `BlTextParagraphLeaf` subclass (canvas specific).

Used mainly 
- to get an index in a text span from a 2D position
- to get a 2D position from a text span index
